# WatchKit Tutorial

Hello, we've written this project to accompany the [blogs at Calvium](calvium.com/blog) helping to introduce the features inside WatchKit such as:

* hierarchical navigation
* tables
* paged navigation
* context menus
* modal dialogs
* maps
* synchronising data between watch and iPhone app
* glances

This project is the completed colour app that should look like this:

Note: you will need to be using XCode 6.2 with iOS 8.2 or above to get this project to work!

Finally, I've included all the blog markdown in the "tutorials" folder in order if you'd prefer to work through things that way :smile:
